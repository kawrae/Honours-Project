# Honours Project

**A Comparative Performance Analysis of Widely Used PHP MVC Frameworks**

This repository contains the source code, benchmarking artefacts, and experimental results for my BSc (Hons) Web and Mobile Development Honours Project at the University of the West of Scotland.

The project evaluates the **performance, scalability, and architectural trade-offs** of four widely used PHP MVC frameworks under identical conditions:

- Laravel
- CodeIgniter
- Symfony
- Yii

## Project Overview

**Student:** Corey Black  
**Banner ID:** B01651145  
**Programme:** BSc (Hons) Web and Mobile Development  
**Institution:** University of the West of Scotland  

### Aim
To conduct a controlled and reproducible performance comparison of popular PHP MVC frameworks, focusing on response time, throughput, and scalability under increasing load.

### Objectives
- Implement functionally equivalent REST API applications in each framework  
- Execute controlled benchmarks using Apache JMeter and Locust  
- Measure average latency, tail latency (P95), throughput, and error rates  
- Analyse architectural and developer-experience trade-offs  
- Produce reproducible, defensible experimental results
